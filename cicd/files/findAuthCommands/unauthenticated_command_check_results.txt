Jenkins CLI
Usage: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s URL] command [opts...] args...
Options:
 -s URL              : the server URL (defaults to the JENKINS_URL env var)
 -webSocket          : connect using WebSocket (the default; works well with most reverse proxies; requires Jetty)
 -http               : use a pair of HTTP(S) connections rather than WebSocket
 -ssh                : use SSH protocol rather than WebSocket (requires -user; SSH port must be open on server)
 -i KEY              : SSH private key file used for authentication (for use with -ssh)
 -noCertificateCheck : bypass HTTPS certificate check entirely. Use with caution
 -noKeyAuth          : do not try to load the SSH authentication private key. Conflicts with -i
 -user               : specify user (for use with -ssh; must have registered a public key)
 -strictHostKey      : request strict host key checking (for use with -ssh)
 -logger FINE        : enable detailed logging from the client
 -auth [ USER:SECRET | @FILE ] : specify username and either password or API token (or load from them both from a file);
                                 for use with -http.
                                 Passing credentials by file is recommended.
                                 See https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/cli-http-connection-mode for more info and options.
 -bearer [ TOKEN | @FILE ]     : specify authentication using a bearer token (or load the token from file);
                                 for use with -http. Mutually exclusive with -auth.
                                 Passing credentials by file is recommended.
