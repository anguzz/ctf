You follow the left fork from the Crooked Table Fork and soon arrive at the base of a tall, spiraling tower made entirely of stacked hats. Top hats, sun hats, teacup hats, even hats wearing smaller hats.

At the base is a crooked wooden sign:

> “Hats above, heads below. Knock thrice and up you go.  
> The March Hare lives here... or at least visits sometimes.”

A stone hat-shaped door greets you. There’s no handle, but a voice booms from within:

> “One hat is useful, one is flair, one hides a secret in the air.”

Below the riddle are three strange hats on pedestals. A plain bowler hat. A dazzling top hat with sparkles. A floppy sun hat with a feather that twitches. The Top Hat whispers to you, “This is a simple cipher. You replace letters with a number: A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. See if you can decrypt it.”

You make your choice:

20-15 16-9-3-11 20-8-5 2-15-23-12-5-18 8-1-20, 7-15  
20-15 16-1-7-5 19-5-22-5-14-20-25 14-9-14-5 20-15.  
16-9-3-11 20-8-5 20-15-16 8-1-20, 7-15 20-15 16-1-7-5  
5-9-7-8-20-25 20-23-15. 20-15 16-9-3-11 20-8-5 6-12  
15-16-16-25 19-21-14 8-1-20, 7-15 20-15 16-1-7-5 14-9-14-5-20-25
```


The key is given to you that it's a substitution cipher, so I just ran it through https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher
