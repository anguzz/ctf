You find yourself in a quiet room, dimly lit and hushed like a forgotten memory. The walls are smooth, without window or seam, save for a single object: a tall, antique grandfather clock standing sentinel in the center of the space. Its pendulum swings with deliberate rhythm, but no time is marked on its pale, round face. Still, it ticks.

**Tick.  Tock.  Tick.**

Then, a soft chime rings out. Not loud, but resonant, as though echoing through time itself.

**DING.**

With a gentle click, a hidden compartment slides open just below the clock’s face. Inside rests a small brass key, *warm* to the touch, and attached to it, a curling paper tag that reads **“42”**

Before you can puzzle it out, the clock shudders, and with a slow groan, the entire case swings backward, revealing a narrow doorway behind it. A pale light flickers beyond. Compelled by something you can’t quite name… curiosity, perhaps, you step through.

The world you enter is not quite like the one you left. Trees twist skyward beside colourfully flowered bushes. The sky, if that’s what it is, shines in lavender hues, and gravity feels just a little too light, as if whimsy itself is tugging at your heels. Suddenly, a flash of white darts across your path.

A white rabbit, clothed in a crimson waistcoat, glancing nervously at a golden pocket watch, scampers by with a flurry of urgency.

> "I'm late! I'm late!" he exclaims, without looking up.

And without thinking, you give chase.

Moments later, you tumble, quite literally, down a hidden rabbit hole.
