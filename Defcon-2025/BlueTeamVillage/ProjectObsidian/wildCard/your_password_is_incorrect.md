You're a security analyst at POTATO PETE LLC investigating a potential password breach.

Your mission: Crack the password hashes and analyze compliance with the company's password policy.

Company Password Policy:

    Minimum 8 characters
    Must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    No common words, usernames, or company names
    No sequential characters (123, abc, etc.)

Some of these passwords are so weak, they're practically begging to be cracked. Others... well, let's just say someone actually read the security policy.

You'll need to find your own wordlist - just like in real investigations!

Flag format: btv{weakestpassword_strongestuser}

Example: If weakest password is "password" and strongest user is "elmo": btv{password_elmo}

Good luck, defender! üîê

Flag format is btv{....}


View Hint

Start by identifying the hash types in hashes.txt. MD5 hashes are 32 characters, SHA1 are 40 characters, SHA256 are 64 characters, and bcrypt starts with $2a$12$.
View Hint

For password cracking, you can use online tools for simple hashes or download tools like hashcat. Try common wordlists like rockyou.txt - it contains millions of real passwords.
View Hint

Some hashes might be from common passwords like "password", "123456", "admin". Check if any usernames appear in the wordlist. Look for patterns: username + "123", username + "!", etc.
