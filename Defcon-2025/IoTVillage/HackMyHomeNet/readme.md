What's the Matter with my smart home?

Bitdefender invites you to solve a few challenges that will get you familiar with the inner workings of the Matter protocol. Smart homes promise seamless living with lights, locks, sensors, and thermostats, all speaking the same language.

But behind the comfort of voice commands and automated routines lies a tangled web of wireless protocols and IoT standards like Matter.

This CTF aims to give you hands-on experience in discovering Matter IoT devices, understanding Matter-specific protocols, interacting with Matter controllers, and identifying integration vulnerabilities that may allow unauthorized control of devices. The CTF culminates with a challenge that demonstrates the tangible, physical consequences that can result from actions taken in the cyber domain. In this task, you will be challenged to unlock a physical door secured by a smart lock. The contents behind the door will remain undisclosed until completion, but it will be a surprise, for sure. So do not give up, keep trying!

Good luck!
