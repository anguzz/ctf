# solve

The following code in `chall.py` demonstrates it’s  generating a number between 2^127 and 2^128−1. This guess is also enforced in the code.

```python
secret =  secrets.randbelow(1 << 127) + (1 << 127) # Choose a 128 bit number
```


Probing with these large numbers shows

```bash
angus@angusMintDev:~$ nc play.scriptsorcerers.xyz 10087
[1] Provide a number

which gave me 0 and 1 which was being generated by

```python
div = secret / fl_num
```

so our number has to be in between which told me this was a binary search. Doing this manually would suck as seen above and our ctf prompt said it would be a programming problem. I did not want to run this all the way through so made `solve.py` to keep an open NC tcp connection and send/recieve responses while performing a binary search.
