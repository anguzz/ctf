``` You land softly on a patch of crimson velvet carpet, embroidered with golden thread in swirling patterns that seem to shift when you’re not looking. Above, the chessboard slide seals itself with a whisper, vanishing into shadow.

You’re in a circular room that is vast, quiet, and dim.

Tall windows, too high to reach, spill beams of pale red light onto the marble floor, which is carved with spirals and symbols you don’t yet understand. At the center stands a pedestal. Upon it: a book, locked shut with a silvery clasp. The air around it buzzes faintly, as if the room itself is waiting.

Inscribed across the wall behind it, etched in looping script, is a challenge:

    “Only the truly puzzled may proceed.
    Speak the answer aloud, and the court shall listen.”

A hush falls, deeper than silence.

You step toward the pedestal.

The puzzle begins now.
