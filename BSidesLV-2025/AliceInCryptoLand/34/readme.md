The March Hare peers over the rim of his mismatched teacup, blinking rapidly then declares this appear to be a Playfair cipher or Playfair square or Wheatstone. Playfair cipher which is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal diagram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair for promoting its use.

He harrumps as he says, “Playfair, you say? Oh yes, yes, very fair indeed. Except when it isn’t. It’s all about pairs, you see. Letters! Dancing in twos!”

He clears his throat and jabs at a napkin where he’s scribbled a curious 5x5 grid of letters. “First, you must make your table!” “Five across and five down, filled with letters but mind you, no J! That one’s always pretending to be an I.

You need a keyword, something delightfully peculiar, and you fill in the grid with the letters of your keyword first, skipping any repeats. Then you finish the table with the rest of the alphabet, like setting seats at a mad little tea party.”

He spins a spoon like a compass needle, pointing around the imaginary grid.

> “Now! Take your message and split it into pairs. If a pair has matching letters, you must insert a filler, an X usually works. And if you have an odd letter left over at the end, well, pair it with another X!”

The March Hare claps. “Simple as teacakes! Just remember: everything is a little sideways in this cipher. Much like myself!”

He hands you a page with a warning scrawled in jam:

> *“A clever pair finds the truth beneath the squares.”*
